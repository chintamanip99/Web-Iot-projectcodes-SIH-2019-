                                                      Power consumption monitoring for industrial machines
                                                      and suggestion for inefficient consumption by any particular machine.
                                                          We have used Raspberry Pi B+, Arduino Nano, NRF24L01 module
                                                      and voltage and current sensors to give solution for the given 
                                                      problem statment.
                                                          We have used Raspberry Pi in our  project solution as the
                                                      computing power of Raspberry Pi is more than microcontrollers.
